# OpenGenerationGM
I wrote a not a big library to generate various content, it may be a labyrinth, landscape, dungeon in the spirit of Roguelike Dungeons, caves, and so on, can be used in any game genre, regardless of graphics (2D or 3D). Most of the library is already ready, but I will still try to add different generation algorithms :)
